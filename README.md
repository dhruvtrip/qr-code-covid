# Covid-19 Testing QR scanner ðŸ˜·

Hope you are safe and healthy. This is a quick and easy way to testing facilities and vaccination centres ðŸ’‰ around the United States. 

PS: I just wanted to practice some CSS skills and merge testing and vaccination resources.

Scan the QR code to get state-wise covid testing facilities or use the button to redirect to vaccination centres in the US.
